	I don't have to manually save different versions and can look at every change which was made earler.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	I think pros are that the commits can refer to single logical changes.
	The cons are that it can be forgotten.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because some changes in different files can be related to each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	With git log I can see all commits and with git diff I can compare two different versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	Because I can go back two older versions at any time.
